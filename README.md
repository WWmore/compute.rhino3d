## Link local or remote server of Python implementation by Hops
A user-friendly design tool has been realized by integrating the optimization into the CAD system Rhinoceros3D. Our plugin allows the user to define the main inputs to the optimization, the initial mesh, the web type, strip width and optimization parameters like the number of iterations and weights. The results, namely the optimized mesh,
strip boundaries in piecewise quintic Bezier form, ruling vectors, the developable strips as well as their developments are returned as Rhinoceros3D geometry objects. The optimization is implemented in CPython and called from Grasshopper, Rhinocerosâ€™ parametric design extension, using the [Hops component](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/compute/hops-component/). This allows the user to offload the actual computation to a more powerful remote machine, if desired.
